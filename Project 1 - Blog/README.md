# Write a Data Science Blog Post

Blog Post: https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/3835643869595990717/2788433774923437791

## Motivation
The project has been done as part of the Udacity Data Science Degree and looks into a variety of factors driving host ratings. It assumes that hosts want to achieve higher ratings due to the associated impact on being able to charge higher prices and have a higher booking utilisation.

Three separate questions were analysed:

1) Does Host responsiveness pay off? Is there a relationship between host responsiveness before booking and quality rating by customers
2) How to optimise my Host rating? What quality factors are the most significant drivers of overall ratings
3) Cleaning Fee : Does charging a separate cleaning fee make customers unhappier
